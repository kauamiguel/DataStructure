Hello dear,


I have seen on my college that most of students know about data strcuture in high level language and 
know ho to use with one command line, but if a problem happens, then, no one can understend what is happening. So, knowing that C is a low level language and you can control memory with him, i decided to create a sequence of main data structure in C that students can see what is going on behind the code of the most 
common languages.

Thanks to see this repository.
